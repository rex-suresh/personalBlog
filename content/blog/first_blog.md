## First blog, Learned a new thing

- This is my first Blog
- Very less things to explain, but I came to know about Hugo's themes
    I assume that Hugo uses a lookup rules internally through themes to determine how a page should be built
- But this is cool I like this.

### Starting up.

- Well Setup for HUGO is as follows
  1. `brew install hugo` in terminal
  2. `hugo new site 'site_name'` creates a folder with the given site_name
  3. `cd site_name/themes`;
  4. select a theme for your site
  5. `git clone {theme-repo}` link from github, clones the theme repo.
  6. read the config of theme's example site
  7. look at the directory structure of example type template.
  8. Try to understand how hugo uses templates and layouts from themes.
  9. learn about place holders and logic behind template generation for hugo.

- and done. Start creating your website.
